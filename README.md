# Skript Command Template Builder

This is a web-based React application designed to help Minecraft server developers and content creators generate the pre-trigger part of Skript command templates easily.

---

How It Works:

1. Open the App: Launch the app in your browser https://avengerdcfan13yt.github.io/skript-command-builder/
2. Add Command Arguments: Enter the arguments you want for your Skript command, specifying types and names.
3. Preview the Template: The app generates a live preview of the command template up to the trigger point.
4. Copy Template: Once you are satisfied, you can copy the generated template to your Skript file for further editing or deployment.

The interface is designed to be intuitive, with each argument clearly displayed and the template formatted correctly for use in Minecraft Skript.

Notes:

- This tool only generates the command up to the trigger; you need to add the command actions manually.
- Supports multiple arguments and provides a structured layout for easy editing.
